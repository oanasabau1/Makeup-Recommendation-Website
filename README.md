## Makeup Recommendation Website

Designed and developed a full-stack application for makeup product recommendations, implementing design patterns such as Factory and Builder, and email functionality via Java Mail. Implemented user authentication with two types of users (admins and clients). Admins can view and export statistics, manage makeup products, while clients can add, update, and delete their own reviews. Created a responsive and intuitive user interface with ReactJS, enabling seamless navigation and interaction for all user operations.
